This Python package allows the calculation of distance between two polygons. Polygons may have thematic attributes (e.g. name) to add further description.

The available geometric distance functions between polygons are:
* Hausdorff distance
* Chamfer distance
* PoLis distance
* Turn function distance

The avaiable thematic distance functions are:
* Levenshtein distance
